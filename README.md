### Hi there, I'm Sarah (she/her) 👋

Welcome to my Github!

	🫐 I interned at Techintern.io as a full stack developer last summer
	
	🍏 I am a 3rd year student studying computer science at the University of Toronto
	
	🍓 I enjoy integrating art and graphic design with software in my projects, especially in areas of web development and UX/UI
